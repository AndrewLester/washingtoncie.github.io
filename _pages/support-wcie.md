**Join Us to Support Students and Families in International Education**

We thank you for your interest in the Washington Center for International Education. We look forward to meeting you and hope you can join our programs. We are often asked how people can support what we do. If you are interested not only in joining our programs but also in supporting our mission, we invite you to consider the following:

**Volunteer**

Some of our activities and programs require volunteer support. Please let us know if you may be interested in supporting one of our programs (for students, parents, or educators), and we will be glad to update you about current and future events. (NOTE: All volunteers must provide references and complete a background check.)

**Program Support**

We are always hoping to find support for programs that will extend our impact in the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond. The issues we address are of crucial importance to primary, secondary,  schools and higher education, as well as to the students and families we serve.

We invite you to consider supporting programs including our Student Service Learning programs, Community Service Weeks, programs serving refugees being resettled in the area.

**Core Support**

Finally, please contact us if you share our vision of a focused effort to support students, their families, and the educators that serve them. We take a long-term view of these issues— even amid the urgent short-term need to clearly reemphasize our country's welcome of top students from around the world. We'd love to talk to you about your vision for internationally-oriented education, and we're open to deep collaboration with individuals and organizations.
