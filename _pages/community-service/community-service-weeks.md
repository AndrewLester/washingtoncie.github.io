# Community Service Weeks
**Join our "Community Service Week" activities. Think globally, serve locally!**

We have offered Community Service Weeks twice a year, in partnership with English Now!, since 2016. Community Service Weeks offer many options to participate in small group community service activities. Our Spring 2021 Community Service Week took place April 12-22; and our Fall 2021 Community Service Week will take place September 10-19.

We organize Community Service Week activities to connect the international and the local communities - and to inspire us all. In addition many activities are online so accessible to everyone, around the world. See the flyer from Spring 2021 for information about the kinds of programs we organize.

Activities will focus on topics that many people in our school community care deeply about:
- **helping neighbors in need** with a food and household goods collection (or order online);
- **fighting racism;**
- **supporting refugees in our local community;** and
- **taking action against climate change.**
**Many, many thanks to the Community Service Week Steering Committee of six students and two English Now!/WCIE colleagues that helped us design this program!** And please let us know if you'd be interested in getting involved in these kinds of activities in the future.
